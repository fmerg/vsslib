## Generation

```js
import { initBackend, generateKey } from "vsslib";

// Initiate cryptosystem over the ED25519 elliptic curve
const ctx = initBackend("ed25519");

// Generate keypair over the fixed cryptosystem instance
const { privateKey, publicKey } = await generateKey(ctx);
```

Alternatively, extract the public counterpart as follows:

```js
// Generate key over the fixed cryptosystem instance
const { privateKey } = await generateKey(ctx);

// Extract public counterpart from key
const publicKey = await privateKey.getPublicKey();
```

### Serialization

Derive the byte representation of a public key as follows.

```js
const publicBytes = await publicKey.asBytes();  // uint8 array
```

Retrieve the public key instance from its byte representation as follows.

```js
const receivedPublic = new PublicKey(ctx, publicBytes);
```

### Prover's side

Generate a NIZK (Schnorr) proof-of-knowledge of the key's secret value as
follows.

```js
const proof = await privateKey.proveSecret({ algorithm: "sha256", nonce: ... });
```

The optional `algorithm` parameter specifies the hash function of the
Fiat-Shamir transform (defaults to SHA256). The optional `nonce` parameter is
any bytestring maintaining state between prover and verifier, so that the
latter defends themselves against replay attacks.

### Verifier's side

Verify the proof against respective public key as follows:

```js
await publicKey.verifySecret(proof, { algorithm: "sha256", nonce: ... });
```

This throws `InvalidSecret` error in case of verification failure,
which you will usually have to handle:

```js
import { InvalidSecret } from "vsslib";

try {
  await publicKey.verifySecret(proof, { algorithm: ..., nonce: ... });
  ...
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof InvalidSecret) {
    // Follow policy as specified by context
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Elgamal encryption

Elgamal encryption schemes differ on how the decryptor is "encapsulated" under the hood
in order to "translate" the original message to the final ciphertext, i.e., by means of
raw group operation (as in plain encryption) or by means of some AES operation,
where an ephemeral symmetric key is produced.

### Encryption

The key API exposes a uniform encryption interface which abstracts away the encapsulation details.

```js
const { ciphertext, randomness, decryptor } = await publicKey.encrypt(message, { scheme: ..., ... });
```

The obligatory `scheme` parameter specifies the desired encryption scheme (see
below for the available options), which moreover specifies the acceptable
format of `message`. The rest parameters are optional and relate to the
selected scheme.

`ciphertext` refers to the main output of the encryption operation.
`randomness` is the random scalar generated during the process, which
admits further processing in some protocols and can be used to prove that the
operation was not bogus. The `decryptor` can be employed in
protocols where decryption is delegated to third parties
(see Sec. [Elgamal decryptors](#decryptors) for details).

> **Warning** Both `randomness` and `decryptor` can be used to
> retrieve the original message without knowledge of the recipient's private
> key. If not immediately discarded, make sure that they do not leak.

The encryption operation may not complete if the provided message is not well
formatted with respect to the specified scheme. You may want to handle
separately the respective error as follows.

```js
import { ElgamalError } from "vsslib";

try {
  const { ciphertext, ... } = await publicKey.encrypt(message, { scheme: ..., ... });
  ...
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ElgamalError) {
    // Handle encryption error
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
}
```


#### <a name="dhies-encryption"></a>DHIES-Encryption (DH-based Integrated Encryption Scheme)

In this case, `message` can be any bytestring.


```js
const message = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from("destroy earth"));

const { ciphertext, ... } = await publicKey.encrypt(message, { scheme: "dhies", algorithm: "sha256", mode: "aes-256-cbc" });
```

The optional `algorithm` parameter specifies the hash function used to generate
the attached MAC (defaults to SHA256).
The optional `mode` parameter specifies the AES block mode for the involved
symmetric operation (defaults to AES-256-CBC).


#### <a name="hybrid-encryption"></a>Hybrid encryption ("Key Encapsulation Mechanism")

In this case, `message` can be any bytestring.


```js
const message = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from("destroy earth"));

const { ciphertext, ... } = await publicKey.encrypt(message, { scheme: "hybrid", mode: "aes-256-cbc" });
```

The optional `mode` parameter specifies the AES block mode for the involved
symmetric operation (defaults to AES-256-CBC).

#### <a name="plain-encryption"></a>Plain encryption

In this case, `message` must be the byte representation of a group element.

```js
const message = await randomPublic(ctx);

const { ciphertext, ... } = await publicKey.encrypt(message, { scheme: "plain" });
```

No optional parameters apply for this scheme.

> **Warning**: Plain encryption is semantically but not CCA secure.
> Make sure that it is securely employed in context by other means.

### Decryption

The decryption interface is uniform for all encryption schemes
(see Sec. [Encryption](#encryption)).

Given a `ciphertext` generated in any of the above ways, use the respective private key to
recover the original message as follows.

```js
const plaintext = privateKey.decrypt(ciphertext, { scheme: ..., ... });
```

The obligatory `scheme` parameter specifies the expected encryption scheme and
should coincide with that used during ciphertext generation.
The rest parameters are optional and should
coincide with those applied during ciphertext generation.

#### Decryption failure

Depending on scheme, the decryption operation may fail to complete throwing
`ElgamalError` (e.g., if the included MAC is found invalid in case of DHIES decryption).
You may need to handle this error separately.

```js
import { ElgamalError } from "vsslib";

try {
  const plaintext = privateKey.decrypt(ciphertext, { scheme: ..., ... })
  ...
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ElgamalError) {
    // Handle decryption error
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
}
```

### <a name="encryption-with-proof"></a>Encryption with proof

In some cases, the encrypting party must prove knowledge of the random nonce,
e.g., in plain ElGamal encryption, where a proof of randomness may be attached
in order to serive a CCA-secure ciphertext.

```js
const { ciphertext, proof } = await publicKey.encryptProve(message, { scheme: "plain" })
```

Decryption with proof verification proceeds as follows.

```js
const { plaintext } = await privateKey.verifyDecrypt(ciphertext, proof, { scheme: "plain" })
```

#### Standalone proof-of-randomness

If a ciphertext has already been generated as [here](#encryption), a proof of
randomness can be explicitly generated as follows.

```js
const proof = await publicKey.proveEncryption(ciphertext, randomness, { algorithm: "sha256" });
```

Verification proceeds as follows.

```js
await privateKey.verifyEncryption(ciphertext, proof, { algorithm: "sha256" });
```

### Decryptors

The decryptor interface is uniform for all encryption schemes
(see Sec. [Elgamal encryption](#elgamal-encryption)).

Given a `ciphertext` and `decryptor` generated in any of the above ways,
recover the original message as follows.

```js
import { decryptWithDecryptor } from "vsslib";

const plaintext = await decryptWithDecryptor(ctx, ciphertext, decryptor, { scheme: ..., ...});
```

The obligatory `scheme` parameter specifies the expected encryption scheme and
should coincide with that used during ciphertext generation.
The rest parameters are optional and should
coincide with those applied during ciphertext generation.

#### Verification

In practice, it is usually the recipient of a ciphertext who delegates decryption
by sending the decryptor to some third party.

```js
const { decryptor, proof } = await privateKey.computeDecryptor(ciphertext, { algorithm: "sha256", nonce: ... });
```

The output `proof` is a NIZK (Chaum-Pedersen) proof that `decryptor` is not
a bogus value regarding the ciphertext, making it verifiable on behalf of the
third party. The optional `algorithm` parameter specifies the hash function
of the Fiat-Shamir transform during proof generation (defaults to SHA256). The
optional `nonce` parameter can be any bytestring used for maintaining state between the
recipient and the decrypting party for the purpose of defending against replay
attacks.

Before applying the decryptor in order to retrieve the original message,
the decrypting party should normally verify that it corresponds indeed to the
ciphertext. It does so against the recipient's public key as follows.

```js
import { decryptWithDecryptor, InvalidDecryptor };

// Verify the decryptor against the provided ciphertext with respect to its
// recipient's public key
try {
  await publicKey.verifyDecryptor(ciphertext, decryptor, proof, {
    algorithm: "sha256", nonce: ...
  });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof InvalidDecryptor) {
    // Follow policy as specified by context
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
}

// Proceed to message recovery
const plaintext = await decryptWithDecryptor(ctx, ciphertext, decryptor, {
  scheme: ..., ...
});
```

## Signatures

The key API exposes a uniform interface for signing messages in raw-bytes
format.

```js
const message = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from("destroy earth"));
```

### Schnorr signature

Below, the optional `algorithm` parameter specifies the hash function of the
Fiat-Shamir transform (defaults to SHA256).

```js
const signature = await privateKey.signMessage(message, { scheme: "schnorr", algorithm: "sha256" });
```

The signature is verified as follows.

```js
await publicKey.verifySignature(message, signature, { scheme: "schnorr", algorithm: "sha256" });
```
